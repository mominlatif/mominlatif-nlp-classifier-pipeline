# ðŸ§  NLP Preprocessing Pipeline & Text Classification

This repository demonstrates an **end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline** for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. It is designed as part of an intermediate-level machine learning task and can be applied to multiple use cases such as **spam detection, sentiment analysis, or news categorization**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The project covers the following stages:

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load datasets such as SMS Spam Collection, IMDB Movie Reviews, or Kaggle datasets.  
   - Split into training and testing sets.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Convert text to lowercase  
   - Remove stopwords, punctuation, numbers, and special characters  
   - Tokenization  
   - Lemmatization or stemming  

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)  
   - TF-IDF Vectorizer  
   - Optional: Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, spaCy)  

4. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - NaÃ¯ve Bayes  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV  

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Confusion Matrix visualization  
   - Optional: Word importance (model coefficients for interpretability)
